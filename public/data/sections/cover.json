During the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed, built, and deployed a Spring Boot Java web application as a concept plan for the former UW Madison Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions. This site displays information about important figures and commemorations in various traditions through the ancient and medieval world, and showcases my coding approach and attention to detail."
